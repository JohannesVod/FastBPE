# QuickBPE

This is a much faster version of the MinBPE tokenizer from andrej karpathy. The main functions are optimized in c++ and then connected to python using ctypes, so that you can call them conveniently. I already successfully tokenized the entire TinyStories dataset in around 8 minutes, which is ~3.5 gb of text. The main bottleneck is now the regex splitting, which is hard to optimize since i decided to keep it integrated into python (so that it is still easy to change the split pattern). The training algorithm i used is from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16837), which mentions a running time of O(nlog(m)). This is an overestimation. The true running time is O(n + mlog(m)) i think, which is linear in the sequence length in practice. The training took about 2 minutes on ~100mb of text, which seems to be decent. But there is probably still a lot of improvement that can be done. Also the encode function is much slower than the encode_ordinary function if the special tokens are distributed evenly because of the splitting. This still needs to be fixed.

# How to use
You can use the repo in the same way as the MinBPE repo. Make sure to use the 

```python
from minbpe import BasicTokenizer
tokenizer = BasicTokenizer()
text = "aaabdaaabac"
tokenizer.train(text, 256 + 3) # 256 are the byte tokens, then do 3 merges
print(tokenizer.encode(text))
# [258, 100, 258, 97, 99]
print(tokenizer.decode([258, 100, 258, 97, 99]))
# aaabdaaabac
tokenizer.save("toy")
# writes two files: toy.model (for loading) and toy.vocab (for viewing)
```

According to Wikipedia, running bpe on the input string: "aaabdaaabac" for 3 merges results in the string: "XdXac" where  X=ZY, Y=ab, and Z=aa. The tricky thing to note is that minbpe always allocates the 256 individual bytes as tokens, and then merges bytes as needed from there. So for us a=97, b=98, c=99, d=100 (their [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com) values). Then when (a,a) is merged to Z, Z will become 256. Likewise Y will become 257 and X 258. So we start with the 256 bytes, and do 3 merges to get to the result above, with the expected output of [258, 100, 258, 97, 99].

## inference: GPT-4 comparison

We can verify that the `RegexTokenizer` has feature parity with the GPT-4 tokenizer from [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) as follows:

```python
text = "hello123!!!? (ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš”!) ðŸ˜‰"

# tiktoken
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
print(enc.encode(text))
# [15339, 4513, 12340, 30, 320, 31495, 230, 75265, 243, 92245, 16715, 57037]

# ours
from minbpe import GPT4Tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT4Tokenizer()
print(tokenizer.encode(text))
# [15339, 4513, 12340, 30, 320, 31495, 230, 75265, 243, 92245, 16715, 57037]
```

(you'll have to `pip install tiktoken` to run). Under the hood, the `GPT4Tokenizer` is just a light wrapper around `RegexTokenizer`, passing in the merges and the special tokens of GPT-4. We can also ensure the special tokens are handled correctly:

```python
text = "<|endoftext|>hello world"

# tiktoken
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
print(enc.encode(text, allowed_special="all"))
# [100257, 15339, 1917]

# ours
from minbpe import GPT4Tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT4Tokenizer()
print(tokenizer.encode(text, allowed_special="all"))
# [100257, 15339, 1917]
```

Note that just like tiktoken, we have to explicitly declare our intent to use and parse special tokens in the call to encode. Otherwise this can become a major footgun, unintentionally tokenizing attacker-controlled data (e.g. user prompts) with special tokens. The `allowed_special` parameter can be set to "all", "none", or a list of special tokens to allow.

## training

Unlike tiktoken, this code allows you to train your own tokenizer. In principle and to my knowledge, if you train the `RegexTokenizer` on a large dataset with a vocabulary size of 100K, you would reproduce the GPT-4 tokenizer.

There are two paths you can follow. First, you can decide that you don't want the complexity of splitting and preprocessing text with regex patterns, and you also don't care for special tokens. In that case, reach for the `BasicTokenizer`. You can train it, and then encode and decode for example as follows:

```python
from minbpe import BasicTokenizer
tokenizer = BasicTokenizer()
tokenizer.train(very_long_training_string, vocab_size=4096)
tokenizer.encode("hello world") # string -> tokens
tokenizer.decode([1000, 2000, 3000]) # tokens -> string
tokenizer.save("mymodel") # writes mymodel.model and mymodel.vocab
tokenizer.load("mymodel.model") # loads the model back, the vocab is just for vis
```

If you instead want to follow along with OpenAI did for their text tokenizer, it's a good idea to adopt their approach of using regex pattern to split the text by categories. The GPT-4 pattern is a default with the `RegexTokenizer`, so you'd simple do something like:

```python
from minbpe import RegexTokenizer
tokenizer = RegexTokenizer()
tokenizer.train(very_long_training_string, vocab_size=32768)
tokenizer.encode("hello world") # string -> tokens
tokenizer.decode([1000, 2000, 3000]) # tokens -> string
tokenizer.save("tok32k") # writes tok32k.model and tok32k.vocab
tokenizer.load("tok32k.model") # loads the model back from disk
```

Where, of course, you'd want to change around the vocabulary size depending on the size of your dataset.

**Special tokens**. Finally, you might wish to add special tokens to your tokenizer. Register these using the `register_special_tokens` function. For example if you train with vocab_size of 32768, then the first 256 tokens are raw byte tokens, the next 32768-256 are merge tokens, and after those you can add the special tokens. The last "real" merge token will have id of 32767 (vocab_size - 1), so your first special token should come right after that, with an id of exactly 32768. So:

```python
from minbpe import RegexTokenizer
tokenizer = RegexTokenizer()
tokenizer.train(very_long_training_string, vocab_size=32768)
tokenizer.register_special_tokens({"<|endoftext|>": 32768})
tokenizer.encode("<|endoftext|>hello world", allowed_special="all")
```

You can of course add more tokens after that as well, as you like. Finally, I'd like to stress that I tried hard to keep the code itself clean, readable and hackable. You should not have feel scared to read the code and understand how it works. The tests are also a nice place to look for more usage examples. That reminds me:

## tests

We use the pytest library for tests. All of them are located in the `tests/` directory. First `pip install pytest` if you haven't already, then:

```bash
$ pytest -v .
```

to run the tests. (-v is verbose, slightly prettier).

## exercise

For those trying to study BPE, here is the advised progression exercise for how you can build your own minbpe step by step. See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

## lecture

I built the code in this repository in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE). You can also find this lecture in text form in [lecture.md](lecture.md).

## todos

- rename GPT4Tokenizer to GPTTokenizer and support GPT-2/GPT-3/GPT-3.5 as well?
- write a LlamaTokenizer similar to GPT4Tokenizer (i.e. attempt sentencepiece equivalent)
